GIS data - Ballast Point Loop

This is a repository of data collected and created as a part of SSCI 587: Spatial Data Acquisition
at the University of Southern California Spatial Sciences Institute.

Data was collected on Catalina Island, CA in the town of Two Harbors on Wed 03/02/2022.

Data was collected using Esri's Field Maps mobile application and EOS Arrow 100 GNSS receivers. XY accuracy within 1 foot.

Collected:
  1) 3D TRAIL FEATURE - Ballast Point Loop Trail, streamed data counterclockwise every 2 feet by attaching
    GNSS receiver to backpack, originally line feature but updated to autogenerated point features every 5m
    to remedy elevation reconstruction issue
  2) HAZARD POINT FEATURES - hazards identified on trail, with XYZ locational data
